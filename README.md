**Solar System Project ðŸŒŒ**

This project visualizes a simplified solar system using Python and the Turtle graphics library. It demonstrates how to create a space-themed design by drawing planets of various colors and sizes on a black background to mimic outer space. Each planet is represented by colored circles, drawn with the Turtle library's drawing capabilities.

**Project Overview**

Language: Python
Library: Turtle Graphics
Author: Sunil Dangal
Features

**Planet Creation**: Draws circular shapes with distinct colors to represent planets.
Color and Background: Uses different colors for each planet and a black background to create a space-like atmosphere.
Animations: Demonstrates simple animations as planets are drawn in sequence.
Structure

**Design**: Includes diagrams, a flowchart, and pseudocode to illustrate the project structure and flow.
Code: Check out solar_system.py to see how the planets are drawn with Turtle functions like circle(), penup(), pendown(), begin_fill(), and end_fill().
Enhancements: An optimized version using loops and lists is available in solar_system_project.py.
Purpose

This project is a learning demonstration of how Pythonâ€™s Turtle graphics can be used to create visual designs, control drawing speed, and add basic animations. It's ideal for beginners in Python programming who want to explore creative applications.
