In this Solar System Project, we are going to make circles like planets revolving to each other using python code. We are making an algorithm using python and turtle for this project. We are using turtle library to use pen to draw the solar system. We are using different colors for circle planets. We are using background color black for space look. This project will demonstrate how we can design and draw using python turtle.
